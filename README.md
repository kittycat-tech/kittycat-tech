### Hi there, I'm EricaðŸ‘‹

I'm an entrepreneur and a former CEO  who fell in love with software engineering since last year.

I just recently finished my full-stack certification from MIT.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently coding my first commercial SAAS prototype (full-stack), for my business partners.

ðŸŒ± Doing global business is my strength and I'm also studying part-time for the MBA degree at the prestigious Macquarie University. 

âš¡ I love: **C**ooking | **P**laying **c**hess,**p**iano, or **g**olf | **P**laying with my **f**luffy **c**at | **G**ardening
